In the tradition of quality and reliability, Essential Life Realiving is the proud maker and distributor of Aquoo Six Stage Alkaline Water Purifying Device and Aquoo four stage water purifying device. The companyâ€™s goal is simple. It is to bring safe, affordable, efficient and clean alkaline drinking water producing devices.

I developed a WordPress website for a client with a strong brand presence. The site featured a captivating product page, compelling testimonials, and a comprehensive support page. Using Figma as the source of the layout, I delivering a pixel-perfect translation of the design using Elementor Pro and other plugins that fit the WP ecosystem.

The result was a user-friendly platform that effectively showcased their offerings and provided valuable customer support.
