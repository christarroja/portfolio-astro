The Pokedex App is a testament to simplicity and efficiency in web development, thoughtfully built with a modest yet robust tech stack. It relies on GraphQL, Apollo, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Headless UI to provide an unassuming yet engaging web experience. This project presents an array of Pokémon, capturing their essence with minimalistic design and functionality.

Users can explore and search for Pokémon by type, revealing the seamless integration of GraphQL and data management. The Pokedex App prioritizes user experience with an uncluttered interface, where every detail matters. 

Remarkably, the Pokedex App has achieved an impressive score of 95-100 on the Lighthouse web page test, demonstrating its exceptional performance and optimization, making it a standout example of what can be accomplished with the right tools and a commitment to user-centric design.
